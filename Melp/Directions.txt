Normal Mode
BEFORE YOU START!!!! READ THIS In the past our Movie Review project has consisted of 3 models. For this assignment we will not be using the "Person" data model. Your model structure should contain the following:

Movie Model
Title
Genre
IMDB Link
Release Date
Review Model
Name of the reviewer (string, not FK)
Movie being reviewed (FK)
Rating
Optional Age of Reviewer
Optional Gender of the Reviewer
Optional Occupation of the Reviewer
You will be required to create a web form page (.aspx) for all functionality of the movie review database. This includes:

A page to view all of the reviews (possibly Default)
A page to create a review for a movie (how do you pass the movie to the create review page? or do they just select the movie from a dropdown?)
A page to add a movie to the database
A page to modify a movie detail
All pages should be linked together through use of a consistent navigation bar. All pages must have consistent styling / color scheme. You are allowed to start with a color "theme" but you are required to build the HTML yourself. You are not allowed to download a free/paid template from any source.

Hard Mode
All of the requirements of normal mode but include a way to show each movie's average rating.
